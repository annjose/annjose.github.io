  <h3 id="testing-method">Testing Method</h3>
<p>I uploaded a document that contains my notes from a JavaScript course I did a few months ago. These notes were very detailed and formatted as md file, so I thought it will be a good input to try Epsilla. I tried various prompts - all related to the document. I uploaded the same file to Perplexity and asked the same questions and compared the results.</p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>I had tried this tool a few months ago, uploaded a couple of documents and created an application to ask questions about the document. At the time, the product was very nascent and couldn&rsquo;t answer most of the questions. Today when I tried it, I saw a huge improvement. Kudos to the team for making these changes!</p>
<h3 id="my-observations">My Observations</h3>
<p>Epsilla&rsquo;s answers are always accurate. Of all the questions I tried, it did not hallucinate or get confused about any questions. It always referred to the correct location in the document. When I click on the citation, it opened the correct location most of the times. But the preview of these citations were not formatted.</p>
<p>Perplexity also answered everything correctly. For my first query, it fetched additional information from the internet, but I asked it not to do it. From then on, it used only the info from the document. I found Perplexity&rsquo;s answers to be more meaningful and useful to learn the topic at hand. The response was well structured and formatted such that it was easy to read and you get a holistic viee of the answer.</p>
<p><strong>Search History</strong>
Epsilla shows Search history as discrete items instead of as a conversation thread. You can access them from the left side menu, but it is a bit cumbersome.
Perplexity shows it as a conversation, so it is more user-friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Related questions</strong>
Epsilla&rsquo;s suggestions were ok, but not very meaningful. In one or two instances, the related questions were not related to my question.</p>
<p><strong>Citations</strong>
Epsilla shows citations for all the questions and it points to the exact location in the document where the answer to the question is available. I checked all of the citations for the questions I asked and 90% of them were accurate (see below for the one time it didn&rsquo;t work). Perplexity does not show the citations as detailed as Epsilla. It shows a &lsquo;Sources&rsquo; section that shows the document. But it does not show the exact location in the document where the answer is retrieved from.</p>
<p><strong>Quality of response</strong>
While Epsilla answered all questions correctly, I found Perplexity&rsquo;s response to be more meaningful and useful. Epsilla&rsquo;s response is also not always formatted - sometimes, it formats the code snippets, but it doesn&rsquo;t format the main text. This is very different from Perplexity which formats all the responses well and it feels more user-friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Text formatting</strong>
Overall, I found Epsilla&rsquo;s formatting of text (the response and the preview of citations) could be improved a lot. The response text is not formatted (even if the whole file is written in md format). The preview of the citation text is also not formatted. It would be nice if they are formatted - it is easy to read. When text is the main modality of the response, it makes a huge difference in the user experience and the sense of usefulness of the product. Perplexity has a big advantage here. Their responses are well formatted and structured. So you feel like to reading it fully and exploring more.</p>
<p><strong>Summarize document</strong>
When asked to summarize the document, Epsilla could not summarize the document, but Perplexity did. See the details of this use case below.</p>
<p><strong>Out of context questions</strong>
I asked &lsquo;who is the president of the united states&rsquo;. Epsilla and Perplexity said that it doesn&rsquo;t have that information from the source provided, which is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback of the Epsila application</strong>
My first experience as soon as I logged in was a little confusing. I didn&rsquo;t know where the uploaded document was. The left menu showed &lsquo;Current Project&rsquo; where the default project was chosen. I tried clicking on applications and it showed the app annkb_search i had created last time. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out where to find the document. Then i went to the Knowledge Bases section and I was able to see the document I uploaded.
It will be good if the application page can show a link to the knowledge base page. It shows the name of KB in the dropdown, but you cannot navigate to the KB itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>[p] when i made edits in the Applications page and clicked on Knowledge Bases, it reminded me if i want to discard the changes. A good reminder to save the changes, although I did not notice the <em>Save</em> button when I was on the page.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prompts-and-responses">Prompts and Responses</h2>
<h3 id="prompt-1">Prompt #1</h3>
<p><code>what do you know</code>
<strong>Response</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>I have access to various pieces of information related to JavaScript programming, including:

1. How to use the `textContent` and `innerHTML` properties to update DOM elements 
2. The use of spread syntax to concatenate arrays 
3. Optional chaining in JavaScript to safely access properties and call functions 
4. Fetching data from APIs and processing JSON responses 
5. The concept of static methods in classes and method chaining 
6. Instance methods in classes and how they can access instance variables 
7. Handling DOM events such as button clicks and toggling styles 
8. Using `Object.keys()` to retrieve keys from an object and accessing properties dynamically 
9. Various JavaScript event listeners like `DOMContentLoaded`, `scroll`, `change`, `keydown`, and `keyup` 
10. String manipulation methods such as `toLowerCase()`, `toUpperCase()`, and accessing characters by index 

If you have a specific question about any of these topics, feel free to ask!
</code></pre><p>My note - this was awesome - I loved that it showed the citations to the place where those topics are discussed.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20241031105218.png|500|500]]</p>
<p>When I click on a citation, it shows the corresponding location in the note.
But this preview was underwhelming, I wish it was shown with the correct formatting. The content is markdown, so it will be easy to do.
![[Pasted image 20241031105038.png|500|500]]</p>
<p><strong>Perplexity</strong>
Response was more complete and structured. And I liked that it showed a snippet of the key point in those sections.
However, Perplexity did not show the citations to the places in the document.
![[Pasted image 20241031114835.png|600]]</p>
<p>Perplexity showed the Related questions that were inviting and interesting</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>What is the main purpose of this file
- Who created this file
- What data is contained in this file
- Is there any specific software required to open this file
- Are there any notable features or sections in this file
</code></pre><p><strong>Prompt #2</strong> - Who created this file
Prompt: <code>who created this file</code></p>
<p><strong>Epsilla</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>I do not know who created the file, as the search results do not provide information about the creator of the file.
</code></pre><p><strong>Perplexity</strong> - it looked up the internet also, I am not sure if Epsilla is designed to do</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>So while the notes themselves may have been taken by someone else (possibly Ann Jose, based on the GitHub repository mentioned), the original course material and content was created by Jad Joubran as part of his Learn JavaScript online course.
</code></pre><p>After this, I asked Perplexity to use only the text file to answer the questions, not to look up internet. And it followed the instructions from then on.</p>
<p><strong>Prompt #3</strong> - <code>what are the three ways in which you can create a string</code></p>
<p><strong>Epsilla</strong>
You can create a string in three ways in JavaScript: using double quotes <code>&quot;</code>, single quotes <code>'</code>, or backticks <code>`</code>. Double-quote and single-quote strings are exactly the same and do not support string interpolation, whereas backticks support string interpolation</p>
<p>This response was spot on - it found the right place in the document and gave the correct answer. But the result was not formatted. It would be nice if they are formatted well</p>
<p><strong>Perplexity</strong>
It gave the correct information - not only the two line answer, but also the examples that were there in the document and code in JavaScript, which evaluated too.
![[Pasted image 20241031110801.png|500|500]]</p>
<p><strong>Prompt #4</strong> - <code>what is the difference between Array.filter and Array.find?</code>
<strong>Epsilla</strong>
Gave the correct answer - verbatim from the document. But the citation was a little off - it pointed to the midpoint of the section where I describe these concepts. If it had pointed to the top of the section, it would be more meaningful. Again, if the preview is formatted and can show the before/after content, the user can scroll up and down the document.</p>
<p>Also, the related questions shown by both tools were different.
![[Pasted image 20241031111726.png||800]]
The first two questions are not related to filter or find.</p>
<p><strong>Perplexity</strong>
It gave a lot more sophisticated answer where it listed the specific difference between filter and find - that too only from the document.
It gave examples that were there in the document, and executed them and showed the results.
![[Pasted image 20241031111505.png|600]]</p>
<p>Related questions showed by Perplexity were on the topic and more meaningful - edge cases, empty arrays etc.
![[Pasted image 20241031111822.png|600]]</p>
<p><strong>Prompt #5</strong>
<code>I have two strings 'Ann Jose' and 'Liza George'. I want to generate an HTML from this as follows: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ann Jose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liza George&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; What is the best way to do that?</code></p>
<p><strong>Epsilla</strong>
It gave the correct answer as described in the document (use map and join). And it formatted the code snippet - which was a pleasant surprise!
![[Pasted image 20241031112416.png|600|600]]</p>
<p><strong>Perplexity</strong> also gave the correct answer, but again, it was formatted well and more detailed which made a big difference in the experience
![[Pasted image 20241031112347.png|600|600]]</p>
<p><strong>Prompt #6</strong>
<code>Summarize this document with 5 main points</code></p>
<p><strong>Epsilla</strong>
Epsilla responded that it cannot summarize the document
![[Pasted image 20241031112636.png|600]]
<strong>Perplexity</strong>
It summarized it with a good summary - it covered the important concepts in the document. I found it to be very useful
![[Pasted image 20241031112726.png|600]]</p>
<p><strong>Prompt #7</strong>
<code>where can i download the code samples in this document? is it available somewhere in the cloud</code></p>
<p><strong>Epsilla</strong>
Answered it well, it pointed to the github repo and gave a link to the repo.</p>
<p><strong>Perplexity</strong>
gave a more detailed and useful answer - with specific files which contains the samples for specific topics. For example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>1. For basic functions and strings:  
    [https://github.com/annjose/learn-javascript/blob/main/learnjs-course/1-basicfunctions-strings.js](https://github.com/annjose/learn-javascript/blob/main/learnjs-course/1-basicfunctions-strings.js)
2. For numbers, variables, and conditions:  
    [https://github.com/annjose/learn-javascript/blob/main/learnjs-course/2-numbers-variables-conditions.js](https://github.com/annjose/learn-javascript/blob/main/learnjs-course/2-numbers-variables-conditions.js)
