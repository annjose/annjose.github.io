  <p>It has been a week since I started my leave of absence to pivot my career to be more hands on in tech. Here is how my Week 1 was, hence the name Week in Review.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-did-during-the-week">What I did during the week</h2>
<ul>
<li>started learning two JavaScript courses in parallel - <a href="https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/modern-javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern JavaScript by Execute Program</a> and <a href="https://learnjavascript.online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn JavaScript</a>. Each of these courses have different strengths - one is focused on a typical structured format - concept after concept along with a lot of examples and exercises, whereas the other is highlighting the best practices of writing modern JavaScript. One of them follows the spaced repetition format and hence limits how much you can do everyday.</li>
<li>Strength training on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and more than 8K steps 5 out of 7 days. Never before have I been able to do it this way.</li>
<li>connected with a few colleagues and friends who wanted to understand more about my journey and my learning plan.</li>
<li>started piano lessons - yay! I had taken a beginner lesson in 2019, but had to stop when I couldn&rsquo;t do it along with work. I found a nice teacher nearby who teaches multi-level class where each student will be at a different skill level, but they all learn and play together as an emsemble. Fascinating concept. Can&rsquo;t wait to learn.</li>
<li>walked around the neighbhorhood for all errands - farmer&rsquo;s market, grocery shopping, piano lessons. It was amazing to walk instead of drive.</li>
<li>cleared a huge pile of papers on the home office room - it has been in bad shape for the last 6 months. Finally they are sorted out and clean</li>
<li>created a GitHub repo to consolidate all my learnings - sample code, exercise challenges etc. <a href="https://github.com/annjose/learn-javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/annjose/learn-javascript</a>. Also took detailed notes in Obsidian, linking it to the github repo.</li>
<li>today my husband and I went for a bike ride along the Los Gatos creek trail - we hadn&rsquo;t used the bike for years, but it was in good condition. It was a beatuiful day and the ride was lovely.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-i-learned-this-week---the-insights">What I learned this week - the insights</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Time flowed at a controlled pace, allowing me to be fully present in whatever I am doing - studying, coding, cooking or even doing chores. Never had I felt like that earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s LinkedIn post gathered a lot of feedback and engagement - it was surprising to learn that a lot of people are in the same boat as me - want to be more hands on. I am grateful for the support and encouragement from everyone - from my college friends, all the way to members of my team - it was amazing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had long conversations with my dad during my mornings (his evening time). I walked him trhough my learning plan and he gave feedback. It was really nice to talk to him without the sense of hurry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I realized that I enjoy doing the exercise - the specific program that I followed is different too - it focuses on self discovery as opposed to a trainer telling you want to do. I never felt demotivated to do it - I really wanted to do it every morning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of coding courses these days are following the learning pattern of spaced repetition, wherein they teach a concept, ask questions on the topic, give coding challenges, then repeat the same questions the next day and a few days after that. This helps you retrieve what you learned and remember it for the longer term..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a Week Blueprint is a useful practice to divide up your time to what is most important first every day. It is the &ldquo;ideal day&rdquo;, for example, deep work during the time that you are most productive, meetings when you are in that mode etc. I made a weekly blueprint for myself. Will try it out tomorrow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the pedestrian crosswalks in my neighborhood have a &ldquo;Wave&rdquo; option in addition to &ldquo;Press here to activate&rdquo; . So if you want to cross a road, you don&rsquo;t need to press the black arrow button. You can just wave in front of it and the familiar voice will say &lsquo;Wait&quot; as usual. That was pretty cool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, I found a good rhythm of learning, taking breaks and doing home stuff. My workflow is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>watch the video course - one chapter at a time</li>
<li>write notes in Obsidian as I listen to each part</li>
<li>try the code in VS Code</li>
<li>copy the code to VS Code with syntax highlighting ``````</li>
<li>refine the notes in Obsidian</li>
<li>do the code exercises as per the course, try them in VS Code</li>
<li>refine the notes if there are any new learnings</li>
<li>Check-in (commit and push) the code to GitHub repo</li>
<li>This is where all my code is - github link</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="looking-ahead-to-next-week">Looking Ahead to Next Week</h2>
<p>In the coming week, I aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>be more consistent with the starting time for my daily routine</li>
<li>continue refining time-boxed and varied breaks.</li>
<li>do additional time for piano practice.</li>
<li>plan meals in advance for greater preparedness.</li>
<li>incorporate biking into my routine, particularly for piano class.</li>
<li>primary goals for the upcoming week
<ul>
<li>complete the courses - &ldquo;Learn JavaScript&rdquo; and &ldquo;Execute Program&rdquo;</li>
<li>solidify the exercise routine</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As I conclude this remarkable week, I&rsquo;m filled with enthusiasm for what lies ahead. Right now, I&rsquo;m gearing up for a cycling adventure around Vason Park, ready to embrace the next phase of my journey with open arms. 🚀 #WeekInReview #TechJourney #GrowthMindset</p>
