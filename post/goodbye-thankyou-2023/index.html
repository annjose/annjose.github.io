  <p>Today is a beautiful day, just two more days to end the beautiful year of 2023 - a pivotal year of my career and life.</p>
<p>Reflecting back on the year, I am grateful and content that I was able to experience the year in good health in the midst of wonderful people - my family, friends, and my team/colleagues at Intuit. Now it is time to say goodbye to the year with this note of gratitude and share what I learned this year.</p>
<h3 id="highlights-of-the-year">Highlights of the year</h3>
<p>This year was full of changes, opportunities, and events, but there are a few highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I <strong>expanded my leadership role</strong> at Intuit to take on the responsibility of backend and infrastructure areas of QBO Platform, in addition to Mobile and Search. My expanded role started last year, but that time was mostly spent on learning the platform and solidifying the team - always feeling overwhelmed. This year I became very comfortable in the role and was able to make some big impactful changes that improved the availability and resiliency of the platform. We prioritized the most important work for the team and finished a lot of long-running critical projects. The team was also new to me, but I was able to build a strong relationship of trust and friendship with the team this year. I am proud of my whole team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I embarked on the <strong>exciting journey of Generative AI</strong> this year. Given the responsibility to lead the engineering effort of Gen AI in QuickBooks, I built a small team of passionate engineers committed to making QuickBooks more helpful and personalized using the power of LLMs. Our team was small, but we moved with speed - we launched an MVP in just 6 weeks, followed by Alpha and private Beta launch of Intuit Assist for QuickBooks in 6 months - in close collaboration with the Intuit AI team. I consider this a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build something so quickly in such a niche ever-evolving space. We had a ton of learnings, challenges, and hallucinations ðŸ˜„.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My family is healthy and happy</strong>. This may look like a non-event, but it is very important. Seeing our loved ones happy and thriving in their life is very fulfilling and rewarding. My husband started a new role in his job and is enjoying it thoroughly. My daughter is finishing her junior year and got selected to do an integrated Masters in the same university. I am so happy and proud of both of them. My dad and mom-in-law are also doing well - no major health concerns. My extended family - brother, sister-in-law, brother-in-law, nieces, and nephews are all growing up - got promoted in their jobs, doing well in studies, basketball, taekwondo, and more. We went to India at the beginning of this year and had a wonderful time with my uncles, aunts, cousins, and childhood friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I <strong>doubled-down on my health</strong> after a long delay. Throughout my adult life, I was frustrated by the meager progress in my health journey. Countless times I went in and out of exercise programs, set workout goals and nutrition plans, but nothing would stick beyond 2 weeks, a month at max. All of that changed in the last two months. Now I am doing strength workouts 3 days a week, walking an average of 8000 steps every day. The happiest news is that last week we went on our regular hike to Bear Creek Preserves and I could do the full loop without feeling tired at all. I enjoyed the hike from start to finish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last, but most important highlight - two months ago, I <strong>took a break from work to focus on health and personal development</strong> and started the <a href="https://annjose.com/post/new-beginning/">remagine journey</a>. It took quite a bit of planning and preparation to make sure that my teams were in good hands, but it has been a very important change for me personally. It gave me the time and mental space to focus on my health, learning, and recreation. The progress of this journey is documented <a href="https://annjose.com/tags/new-beginning/">in this series</a>, but the key points include:</p>
<ul>
<li>I followed my passion for learning - and built a good foundation of web development with JS, TS, and CSS.</li>
<li>I picked up piano lessons with the help of a good teacher and ample time to practice regularly, learned a few songs too - just in time for the holidays.</li>
<li>I did a lot of long-pending home improvement work - nothing fancy, just fixing things with proper research instead of replacing them.</li>
<li>I learned to enjoy cooking - make simple things like home-made bread, yogurt, cupcakes, and a lot of Thai and Kerala dishes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="i-am-grateful-that-i-was-able-to-">I am grateful that I was able to &hellip;</h3>
<ul>
<li>lead and work alongside a fantastic team of passionate, driven engineers and help them grow their careers.</li>
<li>build a strong leadership team of managers, principal engineers, and tech leads who are committed and passionate to guiding our teams every single day - doing right by the customers and each individual.</li>
<li>became a more seasoned leader - things that were hard to do two years ago became much easier.</li>
<li>explore Gen AI technology and build a solution for customers with a fantastic team</li>
<li>understand ML and Gen AI in more detail - thanks to the recent advancements by Open AI that made LLMs accessible to everyone, including me with an engineering background.</li>
<li>prioritize my health and fitness - I am exercising and focusing on nutrition every day.</li>
<li>do self-discovery - and learn about myself - what motivates me, what distracts me, what kind of environment helps me focus, what is the best time to do exercise, what kind of food I love to cook, etc.</li>
<li>do daily/weekly reflections regularly using the <a href="https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bullet Journal method</a> - without any bells and whistles.</li>
<li>start learning piano. It is never too late (even at the age of 45), and this is just the beginning.</li>
<li>start learning Spanish - thanks to Duo Lingo!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lessons-i-learned">Lessons I learned&hellip;</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>life is full of hard things - some are thrown at us, some we choose to do. But <strong>hard things won&rsquo;t stay hard forever</strong> - the more frequently you do a hard thing, the easier it becomes. Doing hard things makes you stronger. The trick is to pick the right hard things so that the effort you put in is spent meaningfully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize</strong>. At every stage of my life - as a teen, student, wife, early career, individual contributor, engineering leader, and mother of a child who is going through her own stages of life - I had to prioritize a handful of things over other things. So I dropped a few things and that is ok. I did the best I could at that moment in time. Now I am at a point in life where I can think of what is next. It is easy to get carried away in the absence of a strict office schedule, so I need to build my own strict schedule. I should adjust my priorities and choose what is most important every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the single <strong>most important asset of a company is the team</strong>. Happy high-performing teams build products that make customers happy. If a leader takes care of the team, everything else will follow. Here, &rsquo;take care&rsquo; does not mean being nice to everyone. It is about putting the team - the collective entity - as the first priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be grateful to those who supported you and be proud of what you accomplished</strong> - you can do both at the same time. Nobody can achieve anything alone, so we should be grateful to our family and peers who support us along our journey. But nothing can be achieved without the individual&rsquo;s passion and grit. We need to go climb the mountain, take the long road -  and it is hard - but that&rsquo;s the only way to get to the other side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Health trumps everything else</strong>. Throughout my adult life I was puzzled and frustrated with one question - why do I struggle so much in my health/fitness journey? Why can&rsquo;t I bring the success in one area of my life to the other? I didn&rsquo;t have an answer to this question for a long time, but not anymore. Here is it - yes, I always wanted all of it - career, family, and health. Until now, I have been prioritizing career and family over everything else and hence could not focus on health. Do I regret it? No, that clear prioritization is the reason why I am where I am now and gave me the agency to prioritize health. I am content with that. Now I am ready to outlive, not just survive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Motivation gets you started, grit and discipline get you going</strong>. Watching a video or reading a book or listening to a success story motivates us to try something new. And we start a routine with good intent. But the motivation wears off very quickly and our brains find all the reasons/excuses to procrastinate or pause/stop the routine. The only thing that helps us is the grit, the perseverance, and our belief in deferred gratification. We must tell ourselves - <em>I have already made the decision to do this thing. And I am going to put my head down and do it.</em> If we keep at it, we will see results in days and weeks. The deferred gratification will pay off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&ldquo;All or nothing&rdquo; mindset is bad, bad, bad</strong>. This applies to learning, health, and work. A few anecdotes that come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>(from a Princeton lecture video) trying to do everything perfectly creates an inertia to start the work. The more you think that you want to do a great job, the more you put off the work, waiting for the perfect moment to start. In other words, perfectionism encourages procrastination - what an irony!</li>
<li>(from Seth Godin&rsquo;s book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53479927" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Practice</a>) - the best time to begin is now, right here.</li>
<li>(from a recent HN post), <em>great things are nothing but good things done repeatedly</em>. If you do a little bit everyday, you will get great at it everyday.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Young adults need time to learn things on their own</strong>. As the mother of a young adult, I see the various challenges that my daughter is going through. Some of them may lead to big wins, some may lead to mistakes - either way, I cannot (and should not) make every decision and learn for her. She needs to go through the challenges on her own and learn the lessons herself. As parents, we have done our part to lay the foundation of strong values in our children hoping that they will make the right choices. Now they should make the decisions themselves. The best thing we can do is to give them the confidence that we will be there for them always, always. It feels scary, I know, but that&rsquo;s ok. That&rsquo;s how it should be</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-i-regret">What I regret&hellip;.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nothing. <em>Nada</em>. <em>Niente</em>. I am usually a person of regret - always thinking in terms of &lsquo;I should have done that&rsquo;, &lsquo;I could have done that&rsquo; etc. But no, not anymore. Now I look at everything the way as is - no judgement, no remorse, no regret.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>Life is full of choices - every moment of my life is shaped by the choices I make and the environment around me. I am grateful for that and I am ready for the consequences of my choices - good and bad. So rather than thinking what I should have done, I think what I will do next.</p>
<p><em>Eyes on the stars and feet on the ground - Theodore Roosevelt.</em></p>
<p>Thank you 2023 - you have been wonderful. Now I am ready to embrace the new year with open arms.</p>
