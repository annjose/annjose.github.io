      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to think that I love coding, but in the last year, I came to realize that what I love more is &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; - creating something useful and beautiful. Last year this time, my coding workflow was to fire up VS Code with  Claude in the browser or GitHub Copilot in &amp;lsquo;Ask&amp;rsquo; mode and brainstorm with a model, review solutions suggested by the LLM, copy code into the editor, test and deploy🚀. This was fun in the beginning, but soon the context-switching became tedious and broke the flow of building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While cloud computing drives many AI breakthroughs, a parallel revolution is happening right in our hands - running LLMs locally on mobile devices. This emerging field, known as &lt;strong&gt;Mobile On-device AI&lt;/strong&gt;, enables us to build more private, faster and smarter app experiences - especially as mobile devices become increasingly powerful. As a developer passionate about &lt;strong&gt;AI and mobile&lt;/strong&gt;, I am fascinated by the convergence these two worlds and the possibilities it brings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every day we&amp;rsquo;re seeing fantastic advancements in AI, thanks to more data and powerful computers. This may make it seem like the future of AI is all about getting even more data and bigger computers. But I believe a critical and rapidly evolving piece of the puzzle is about bringing the &lt;em&gt;Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; of Artificial Intelligence onto the devices where the data originates (eg: our phones, cameras, and IoT devices) and doing the &amp;ldquo;smarts&amp;rdquo; using their own computing capabilities. This is the essence of &lt;strong&gt;Edge AI&lt;/strong&gt;, the topic we’ll explore in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cloudflare AutoRAG: RAG on auto-pilot</title>
      <link>https://annjose.com/post/cloudflare-autorag-step-by-step/</link>

      <guid>https://annjose.com/post/cloudflare-autorag-step-by-step/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We know that RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a reliable mechanism to augment LLMs with up-to-date data and ground them on facts relevant to the context of the user query, thereby reducing hallucination. When set up properly, it works pretty well. Companies like Perplexity AI and enterprise applications use RAG extensively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, building a RAG pipeline on your own from scratch can be complex and high maintenance. You need to assemble your data sources, chunk the data, index it, generate embeddings, and store them in a vector database. At inference time, you need to generate an embedding of the user query using an embedding model, retrieve the relevant data from the indexed store and return a meaningful context-aware response to the user. On top of that, any change in the data source means that you need to re-index the data, re-generate embeddings, and update the store. Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Which browser cares about privacy the most?</title>
      <link>https://annjose.com/post/browsers-privacy-compare/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 16:14:23 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://annjose.com/post/browsers-privacy-compare/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I stopped using Chrome a long time ago due to privacy concerns, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been switching between Firefox, Edge, and occasionally Brave. But I never spent the time to fully compare these browsers and analyze which one best suits my needs. Today, I decided to look deeply into these browsers and ended up going down a rabbit hole of researching their privacy features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/strong&gt; Every time we browse a website, we are sharing bits of our digital life with companies we don&amp;rsquo;t know. These companies collect vast amounts of data about our browsing habits, preferences, and personal information.  It is so cringy and annoying to see YouTube showing a &amp;lsquo;suggested video&amp;rsquo; of the dental procedure that you searched about and are planning to get done. The browser you choose plays a significant role in how much of your data is collected and shared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vibe coding a Pomodoro app with AI</title>
      <link>https://annjose.com/post/vibe-coding-pomodoro-app/</link>

      <guid>https://annjose.com/post/vibe-coding-pomodoro-app/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I tried something fun - built a Pomodoro timer app mostly by talking to AI instead of typing code myself. And guess what - there is a term for it - &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;vibe coding&lt;/a&gt;, coined by Andrej Karpathy 😎.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have done it a few times before, but this is the first time I am using it to build a full app. I wanted to create something that was useful and worked well, so I chose the Pomodoro timer. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it went and my key takeaways from this way of building products.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, if you had told me I’d be deadlifting 155 lbs, I would have laughed and said, &amp;ldquo;No way!&amp;rdquo; But here I am, doing it—something I never thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/reimagine-milestone/&#34;&gt;post in my reimagine journey&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about reframing milestones to focus on consistency rather than arbitrary goals. At the time, I was working out on my own, trying to stay active with strength training and Zone 2 walks. I was making some progress, but it was small and I felt stuck. Looking back, I realize it wasn’t a lack of effort—it was a lack of structure, consistency, and progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://annjose.com/post/claude-code-first-impressions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt;, the new agentic coding tool &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;announced by Anthropic&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Unlike other agentic tools, Claude Code is a CLI tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Claude has been my favorite AI coding partner so far. I use it via GitHub Copilot and as standalone through its web interface. I was curious to see how it works in CLI and decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I share my first impressions of using Claude Code - how I set it up, what I loved about it, what I didn&amp;rsquo;t, and how it compares to other similar tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of late, I have been building and &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/browser-extn-intro/&#34;&gt;learning about browser extensions&lt;/a&gt; for a few projects. It was surprising to learn that there are many ways to build UI for these extensions and the most interesting one was the Side Panel UI available to Chrome extensions. In this post, I will talk about the Chrome side panel, how to build one and the advantages and limitations of using it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-chrome-side-panel&#34;&gt;The Chrome side panel&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a vertical panel that opens on either side of the browser window, providing quick access to your bookmarks, history, reading list, and Google Lens. It has a consistent layout and behavior across all websites. It was first introduced in Chrome in May 2023.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://annjose.com/post/v0-dev-firsthand/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using many &lt;a href=&#34;https://vercel.com/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Vercel&lt;/a&gt; products in my web projects - for example, their &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextjs.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Next.js app framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;deployment infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://sdk.vercel.ai/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Vercel AI SDK&lt;/a&gt;. I love these tools because are easy to use and onboard, they are reliable and fast - and most of them are open source, which is fantastic ❤️.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their latest innovation is &lt;a href=&#34;https://vercel.com/ai&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;v0.dev&lt;/a&gt;, an AI-powered tool that helps you build frontend applications using a conversational chat interface. When I first heard about it, I thought it would be just another AI coding tool with a chat interface, similar to asking ChatGPT or Claude to generate code. However, &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/v0/status/1826020673908535325&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;v0.dev recently announced a major update&lt;/a&gt; that includes integration with the popular &lt;a href=&#34;https://ui.shadcn.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;shadcn&lt;/a&gt; UI components and the ability to pull in external npm packages. So I decided to try it out yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of my blog series on browser extensions. Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into advanced concepts including TypeScript integration, service workers, and programmatic script injection. For a solid foundation, I recommend reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/browser-extn-intro/&#34;&gt;Browser Extensions: Part 1 - Introduction&lt;/a&gt; before tackling these more complex topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-use-typescript-in-browser-extensions&#34;&gt;How to use TypeScript in browser extensions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, browser extensions use JavaScript as the programming language in the content scripts. However, TypeScript is more type safe and reliable to write the business logic. You can add TypeScript support to the extension project, but how do you do it? Chrome docs mention this as a one-liner as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nine months ago, I started the &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/new-beginning/&#34;&gt;Reimagine Journey&lt;/a&gt; to shift my career from engineering leadership to hands-on technology, specifically focusing on my health, personal growth and advanced tech skills. The long extended leave gave me the time and space to reflect on what I truly love and shape the next chapter of my career. It gave me the opportunity to determine how I want to live the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Perplexity AI: Insights from the CEO Aravind Srinivas</title>
      <link>https://annjose.com/post/perplexity-ai-ceo-insights/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2024 20:21:42 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://annjose.com/post/perplexity-ai-ceo-insights/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I watched an interview of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aravind-srinivas-16051987/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Aravind Srinivas&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of &lt;strong&gt;Perplexity AI&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.perplexity.ai&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.perplexity.ai&lt;/a&gt;). It is a three-hour interview done by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lex Fridman&lt;/a&gt; where Aravind talked about the major breakthroughs in AI that brought us to LLMs, the mission of Perplexity, how the technology works, his vision of the future of search and web in general, and some valuable advice for startup founders and young people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-gwvmhyU7A&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fascinating interview&lt;/a&gt; - highly recommended for everyone to watch. Personally, it opened my eyes to the fact that Perplexity is very different from other chatbots - not only in how it works, but what it is trying to solve. So I started using it for a few days and was blown away by the results 💯. I realized that this is one of the tools that gives you so much value that you cannot imagine going back to the way of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had heard about it in a few forums and mentioned by industry leaders like Jensen Huang and Kelsey Hightower. In fact, I had created an account and tried it out a few times earlier this year, but didn&amp;rsquo;t take it much seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that changed last week when I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-gwvmhyU7A&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this recent interview&lt;/a&gt; of Perplexity CEO &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aravind-srinivas-16051987/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Aravind Srinivas&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lex Fridman&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The standout feature unveiled at this week&amp;rsquo;s Apple WWDC 2024 event was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/introducing-apple-intelligence-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Apple Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, a personal intelligence system that will be integrated into multiple platforms - iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-apple-intelligence&#34;&gt;What is Apple Intelligence?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple Intelligence comprises of multiple highly-capable and efficient generative models - large language models and diffusion models. These models include on-device models as well as server-based foundation models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The foundation models are trained on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/axlearn&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Apple&amp;rsquo;s open-source AXLearn library&lt;/a&gt; for deep learning, built on top of &lt;a href=&#34;https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JAX&lt;/a&gt; (Python library for accelerated computing and transformation) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tensorflow.org/xla&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;XLA&lt;/a&gt; (Accelerated Linear Algebra, an open-source ML compiler). The branding of Apple Intelligence is intriguing, positioning it as Apple&amp;rsquo;s take on &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Next.js - Migrate from Pages to App Router</title>
      <link>https://annjose.com/post/nextjs-migrate-pages-app-router/</link>

      <guid>https://annjose.com/post/nextjs-migrate-pages-app-router/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, Next.js introduced &lt;strong&gt;App Router&lt;/strong&gt;, a new way to build React applications using the latest features like React Server components and streaming. This was included in Next.js version 13 and is meant to replace the &lt;strong&gt;Pages Router&lt;/strong&gt; eventually. I have been using the App Router for all my &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/learning-to-building/&#34;&gt;builder projects&lt;/a&gt; for a while now. In fact, I usually kicked off projects with the standard &lt;code&gt;create-next-app&lt;/code&gt; script that starts a new app from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months since OpenAI announced &lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/index/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GPT-4 Turbo with Vision&lt;/a&gt; a model capable of understanding images and answering questions based on visual input. Recently, I decided to leverage this in a real app and got valuable insights. This post is a quick summary of my learnings from that experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to use the model through ChatGPT and the Open AI API so that you can can integrate it into any application. I&amp;rsquo;ll wrap up with my observations from using this model in practice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of late, I have been diving into &lt;a href=&#34;https://nextjs.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Next.js&lt;/a&gt; and absolutely loving it. I wanted to put my learnings to practice, so I started building an app to solve a personal pain point. Along the way, I wanted to add authentication for my app and decided to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://next-auth.js.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NextAuth&lt;/a&gt;, the go-to auth library for Next.js. Overall, it was a great experience, with a few humps along the way, but in the end, it all worked out well. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing those experiences and learnings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This was exciting news and we have to try it out immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will do a walk-through of how to download and use the new model and how it compares to other code generating models like GPT-4.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As usual, the best way to run the inference on any model locally is to run &lt;a href=&#34;https://ollama.ai/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Ollama&lt;/a&gt;. So let&amp;rsquo;s set up Ollama first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last shared an update on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/tags/new-beginning/&#34;&gt;Reimagine journey&lt;/a&gt; that started three months ago. Initially, I used to share my progress every week and it helped me build momentum during the early stages. But after some time, this weekly ritual became tedious - sometimes taking up an entire day for a single post. So I decided to share updates based on significant &lt;strong&gt;milestones&lt;/strong&gt; rather than tying them to specific &lt;strong&gt;points in time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now is the perfect time to say goodbye to the year and share the invaluable lessons I have learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is week #4 of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/new-beginning/&#34;&gt;remagine journey&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;s time for the review. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t post it last week because of reasons I will explain below. The previous week&amp;rsquo;s reviews and the full series can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/tags/new-beginning/&#34;&gt;new-beginning tag collection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-was-able-to-do-this-week&#34;&gt;What I was able to do this week&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, here is the honest, bitter, truth - this week (week #4) was super rough for me - in terms of learning and reaching the goals I had set out at the beginning of the week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I attended the &lt;a href=&#34;https://devday.openai.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Open AI Dev Day&lt;/a&gt; on 6 Nov 2023 at SVN West, San Francisco. This event was special in many ways - for me, this is the first conference I attended since the pandemic and the first one during my new journey; for OpenAI, this is their first developer conference ever! So I think it deserves a dedicated blog post to share the highlights, key takeaways and my observations, right? Right!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post has been sitting in my draft for two weeks, waiting for my time to polish and post. But then as usual, I never got to it and it just stayed there. Anyway, now I am gonna just publish. So if you see typos or mistakes, please lmk. Progress, not perfection, yeah?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to review Week #3 of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/new-beginning/&#34;&gt;reimagine journey&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, here we are at Week #2 of the &amp;ldquo;new beginning&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/new-beginning/&#34;&gt;I set forth mid October&lt;/a&gt; - a journey which did not get a specific name, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I guess some things are better served unnamed, yeah? Anyway, let&amp;rsquo;s jump into the review. As always, this is free flow writing and I will follow the same format as &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/week-in-review-week1/&#34; title=&#34;Week In Review - Week 1&#34;&gt;last week&amp;rsquo;s review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-did-during-the-week&#34;&gt;What I did during the week&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An honest review of this week should start by reviewing the goals I set out at the beginning of the week. These are the goals I decided in &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/week-in-review-week1/&#34; title=&#34;Week In Review - Week 1&#34;&gt;my last week&amp;rsquo;s review&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a week since I started my leave of absence to pivot my career to be more hands on in tech. Here is how my Week 1 went. This is mostly a stream of consciousness instead of a well-formatted post, because it was important that I publish it at the end of the week - progress not perfection!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-did-during-the-week&#34;&gt;What I did during the week&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;started learning two JavaScript courses in parallel - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/modern-javascript&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Modern JavaScript by Execute Program&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnjavascript.online/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Learn JavaScript by Jad Joubran&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these courses have different strengths - one is a typical structured course with a set of chapters each explaining a concept, a lot of examples and exercises, whereas the other one is a set of best practices of writing modern JavaScript. I think it is important to understand both. Also, the Execute Program course follows the spaced repetition format and hence limits the amount of material you can cover everyday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A few months ago&lt;/strong&gt;, I stood at the crossroads of my career thinking about my next chapter. I loved my job, my team, and was at the peak of my career as a leader. Yet, I yearned for a return to the world of hands-on development, where I could immerse myself in the flow of code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I want to pivot my career towards the goal of coding, learning and building with tech. But I resisted the urge to act on impulse. Instead, I started a deliberate, step-by-step plan to execute this transition. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I approached it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I wanted to read it immediately but was intimidated by the fact that it is a 100-page document. It turns out that it was not as difficult as I anticipated, it can be easily read over a weekend. The best part is that this report describes the key terminologies and methodologies used in the development of GPT-4. It&amp;rsquo;s always beneficial to obtain this information directly from the source.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since ChatGPT was released to the public last November, I&amp;rsquo;ve been eager to write a blog about it. However, the daunting prospect of facing a blank screen kept me from starting the task, and I found myself procrastinating. Today, I finally summoned the courage to begin writing, but with a few tweaks from my usual approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allow me to describe the meta experiment to understand how I can utilize ChatGPT to help me write the blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, ChatGPT has captured my attention through numerous forums, articles and AI experts. I am fascinated by this technology and learning more about it everyday. With this introductory post, I hope to share my knowledge and insights on ChatGPT - how it works, its capabilities and limitations, potential pitfalls, and future prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note - Just for fun, I did an experiment to write two more versions of this post - one that was written by ChatGPT itself using a rough outline I provided, and another also written by ChatGPT, but imrprovised from my original post. Curious to see the results of the experiment? Head over to the meta post &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/chatgpt-intro-3-ways&#34;&gt;Blog about ChatGPT in three different ways&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had seen her TED talk earlier and this talk was even better where whe unpacked a lot of details on the concept of grit.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I upgraded my &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blog engine Hugo&lt;/a&gt; from version 0.30.0 to 0.73.0. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I upgraded, so I was not sure how easy or difficult it will be. The upgrade completed quickly, but my entire home page (running locally) went blank right after the upgrade. With a good amount of googling, reading through the documentation and a few tweaks in my folder structure, I was able to bring it back up and running and published it. This post is to share my learnings from the experience hoping that it may be useful to somebody else. &lt;em&gt;Learn Teach Learn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a long time, I got the time to tinker with something fun and learn from it, thanks to the week-long break from work. The task at hand is to set up Visual Studio for Mac to compile/run/debug C++ programs. Why, you may wonder - for the past few months, I have been craving to learn something different and I was hooked when I saw the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Adam-Drozdek-dp-1133608426/dp/1133608426&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data Structures and Algorithms in C++&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Drozdek. I decided to read this book and learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What do I really want</title>

      <guid>https://annjose.com/post/what-do-i-really-want/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I watched a TED video where the presenter urged the audience to ask the question &lt;strong&gt;What do you really want?&lt;/strong&gt; That got me thinking what do &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; really want. It is an interesting question to ask myself, since I have tried different roles and responsibilites - broad and deep - in the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I was pleasantly surprised when I found the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Adam-Drozdek-dp-1133608426/dp/1133608426&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data Structures and Algorithms in C++&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Drozdek on my bookshelf. The book is full of code and exercises in C++, a language which I haven&amp;rsquo;t used in a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to mock network requests in iOS</title>
      <link>https://annjose.com/post/mocking-network-requests-ios/</link>

      <guid>https://annjose.com/post/mocking-network-requests-ios/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges of mobile application development is to ensure that the application is resilient to various error responses from the services that are consumed by the application. Mobile devices are more susceptible to network connectivity issues, timeout etc. So we need to take extra care to make sure that we test all error scenarios and handle them in a meaningful manner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-and-why-of-mocking&#34;&gt;What and Why of Mocking&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though we are convinced about the benefits of testing server errors, these services are running in Production serving real customer requests. So it is not possible to make every service API to return these various error responses. So in order to test these scenarios, we need to simulate the server requests locally such that it returns the responses that we want to test. This is what we mean by mocking data requests. These &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; requests will not actually hit the network; the mocking code runs locally and returns the data that corresponds to success or error response.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using GraphQL in my work project for a few months now and I love it. But all my learnings of this technology have been in a hurry and mainly from a consumption standpoint as a mobile developer. So I wanted to learn it much deeper, tinker with it and finally write this blog to share my learnings and cement my understanding. Finally got the time to do it this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Swift 4.2 - What&#39;s New</title>
      <link>https://annjose.com/post/swift42-whats-new/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I would like to share what&amp;rsquo;s new in Swift 4.2. All the code displayed in this post is available at my GitHub repo &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/annjose/my-learnings/tree/master/Swift4.2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my-learnings/Swift4.2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;random-number-generation&#34;&gt;Random Number Generation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Swift 4.2 added random number generator API to standard library. You can use it on &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CGFloat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It also provides a convenient API &lt;code&gt;randomElement&lt;/code&gt; which returns a random element from a sequence&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It also provides the APIs &lt;code&gt;shuffle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;shuffled&lt;/code&gt; to shuffle a sequence&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;table style=&#34;border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;1&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;white-space:pre;-webkit-user-select:none;user-select:none;margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#7f7f7f&#34;&gt;2&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td style=&#34;vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34; data-lang=&#34;swift&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;randomInt&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;.random(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#bd93f9&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;)&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;randomElement&lt;/span&gt; = [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;one&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;two&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;three&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;four&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;].randomElement()&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;dynamic-member-lookup&#34;&gt;Dynamic Member Lookup&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Swift 4.2 introduces a dot syntax to access custom subscripts; this is much cleaner than the earlier square bracket calls. The compiler evaluates the subscript call dynamically at runtime, but provides a cleaner syntax.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yes, I was at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ghc.anitab.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Grace Hopper Celebration 2018 (aka GHC 2018)&lt;/a&gt;, the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest gathering of women technologists. This year, GHC has 20,000 attendees representing 90 countries. It was such an inspiring experience for me that I thought I should share my experiences and learnings with you my friends. Hope you enjoy reading this and be inspired yourself. Also, if you  attended GHC this year, please share your experience as well - either in the comment below or even better, write a blog and share the link!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the wonderful opportunity to attend Google I/O last week and absolutely loved it. I learned a lot of things during the three days. Btw, it was tiring too with the continuous sessions and the sunny Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is an attempt to share the main highlights and the announcements that I found interesting. If you attended the event or watched the sessions online, let me know if there were more things that you found interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TDD in Xcode Playground</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I use Xcode playground a lot in order to write code snippets - either to try out something that I read in a blog, or to demonstrate a code improvement that I want to suggest in a code review, or sometimes even to prototype a design before doing the full-blown implementation in Xcode project. During this experimentation phase, the correctness of the code was verified by analyzing the ouput displayed on the right-hand side column of the playground. This was really cumbersome and error-prone and I was hoping that there would be a better solution for this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their easy-to-use, blazingly fast &lt;a href=&#34;https://realm.io/products/realm-mobile-database/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mobile database&lt;/a&gt; software supports all mobile platforms - iOS, Android, React Native and Xamarin, in Java, ObjC, Swift and C#.&#xA;That is why I am happy to see that today they announced &lt;a href=&#34;https://realm.io/blog/introducing-realm-mobile-platform/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Realm Mobile Platform&lt;/a&gt; that combines Realm client side database with server-side technology (Object Server as they call it). This platform provides the base infrastructure for mobile apps to support offline sync, that enables end users to interact with the app even when there is no network connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of my Machine Learning course, I learned a useful trick which I will share hoping that it may help someone or I myself can refer to it later. The problem at hand was how to display the mathematical expressions that calculate cost function, gradient descent etc. in a blog or web page. In OneNote, you can do it using &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Insert-a-mathematical-equation-in-OneNote-2016-for-Mac-08969f84-ed02-4baf-8a77-7ab3c1e26afe&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OneNote Equation tool&lt;/a&gt; earlier, but I wanted to do the same in my blog posts. After trying many options, here is what worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few weeks ago, I started the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Machine Learning course on Coursera&lt;/a&gt; by Andrew Ng of Stanford University. The course is great, learning a lot of new concepts. Sometimes it is hard, but it is really fun learning this new topic and brushing up the old Math lessons of Linear Algebra, matrix manipulation and derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The course starts with the basics, including a primer on Linear Algebra (it is optional, but I took it anyway since it has been more than a decade when I learned it in college). At the end of each module, there is a quiz and programming assignments, which are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thoroughly enjoying working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ReactNative&lt;/a&gt; projects, but was disappointed by the lack of a good debugging environment. I had tried multiple solutions like &lt;a href=&#34;http://nuclide.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nuclide&lt;/a&gt; (which I found it to be very slow), WebStorm with JSX plugins (which is mainly syntax recognition). So I had to always launch the app from Xcode/Android Studio, then attach Chrome Dev tools and keep switching between all three for debugging. This was frustrating, but there is hope&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://annjose.com/post/conversation-as-interface/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The User Interface is going beyond UI and voice recognition to the new trend of using conversation as a new way to engage with customers, i.e. &lt;strong&gt;Conversation As Interface&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a more natural form of communication, especially for question-answer / interview experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now there is an emerging trend of companies opening their chat bot API to third party developers. Facebook has been running &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/05/facebook-messenger-bots/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;many experiments&lt;/a&gt; in their Messenger app allowing a few developers like Uber, Assist etc. to create chat bots. They are &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/07/facebook-chatbots/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;expected to announce&lt;/a&gt; opening up the SDK to all in next week’s F8 conference. Microsoft &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/30/microsoft-is-bringing-bots-to-skype-and-everywhere-else/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;released a Bot Framework&lt;/a&gt; in Build last week and this supports multiple channels – Slack, SMS, Skype etc. Similarly, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/24/line-builds-out-its-chat-app-for-businesses-as-facebook-messenger-threat-looms-large/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Line&lt;/a&gt; announced its SDK.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog post created by &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a simple, fast and powerful blogging engine written in Go. Setting up my blog on Hugo was quick and easy; it took less than 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have set this up such that I publish the content to &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt;, so the publish workflow is as simple as writing some Markdown and a git push. &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;This is a good tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
