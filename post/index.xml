      <description>AI is reshaping how we live and work - thanks to significant advancements in model capabilities and computational power centered in cloud infrastructure. At the same time, the mobile devices we carry every day - our phones and tablets - are becoming increasingly powerful. As a developer who loves exploring AI and has built mobile apps, I am fascinated by the idea of these two worlds of mobile and AI converging.</description>

      <description>Every day we&amp;rsquo;re seeing fantastic advancements in AI, thanks to more data and powerful computers. This may make it seem like the future of AI is all about getting even more data and bigger computers. But I believe a critical and rapidly evolving piece of the puzzle is about bringing the Intelligence of Artificial Intelligence onto the devices where the data originates (eg: our phones, cameras, and IoT devices) and doing the &amp;ldquo;smarts&amp;rdquo; using their own computing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Cloudflare AutoRAG: RAG on auto-pilot</title>
      <link>https://annjose.com/post/cloudflare-autorag-step-by-step/</link>

      <description>We know that RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) is a reliable mechanism to augment LLMs with up-to-date data and ground them on facts relevant to the context of the user query, thereby reducing hallucination. When set up properly, it works pretty well. Companies like Perplexity AI and enterprise applications use RAG extensively.&#xA;However, building a RAG pipeline on your own from scratch can be complex and high maintenance. You need to assemble your data sources, chunk the data, index it, generate embeddings, and store them in a vector database.</description>

      <title>Which browser cares about privacy the most?</title>
      <link>https://annjose.com/post/browsers-privacy-compare/</link>

      <description>I stopped using Chrome a long time ago due to privacy concerns, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been switching between Firefox, Edge, and occasionally Brave. But I never spent the time to fully compare these browsers and analyze which one best suits my needs. Today, I decided to look deeply into these browsers and ended up going down a rabbit hole of researching their privacy features.&#xA;Why is this important? Every time we browse a website, we are sharing bits of our digital life with companies we don&amp;rsquo;t know.</description>

      <description>Today I tried something fun - built a Pomodoro timer app mostly by talking to AI instead of typing code myself. And guess what - there is a term for it - vibe coding, coined by Andrej Karpathy üòé.&#xA;I have done it a few times before, but this is the first time I am using it to build a full app. I wanted to create something that was useful and worked well, so I chose the Pomodoro timer.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, if you had told me I‚Äôd be deadlifting 155 lbs, I would have laughed and said, &amp;ldquo;No way!&amp;rdquo; But here I am, doing it‚Äîsomething I never thought possible.&#xA;In a previous post in my reimagine journey, I talked about reframing milestones to focus on consistency rather than arbitrary goals. At the time, I was working out on my own, trying to stay active with strength training and Zone 2 walks.</description>

      <description>Today I tried Claude Code, the new agentic coding tool announced by Anthropic this morning. Unlike other agentic tools, Claude Code is a CLI tool.&#xA;Claude has been my favorite AI coding partner so far. I use it via GitHub Copilot and as standalone through its web interface. I was curious to see how it works in CLI and decided to give it a try.&#xA;In this post, I share my first impressions of using Claude Code - how I set it up, what I loved about it, what I didn&amp;rsquo;t, and how it compares to other similar tools.</description>

      <description>Of late, I have been building and learning about browser extensions for a few projects. It was surprising to learn that there are many ways to build UI for these extensions and the most interesting one was the Side Panel UI available to Chrome extensions. In this post, I will talk about the Chrome side panel, how to build one and the advantages and limitations of using it.&#xA;The Chrome side panel It is a vertical panel that opens on either side of the browser window, providing quick access to your bookmarks, history, reading list, and Google Lens.</description>

      <description>This is the second part of my blog series on browser extensions. Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into advanced concepts including TypeScript integration, service workers, and programmatic script injection. For a solid foundation, I recommend reading Browser Extensions: Part 1 - Introduction before tackling these more complex topics.&#xA;How to use TypeScript in browser extensions By default, browser extensions use JavaScript as the programming language in the content scripts. However, TypeScript is more type safe and reliable to write the business logic.</description>

      <description>Nine months ago, I started the Reimagine Journey to shift my career from engineering leadership to hands-on technology, specifically focusing on my health, personal growth and advanced tech skills. The long extended leave gave me the time and space to reflect on what I truly love and shape the next chapter of my career. It gave me the opportunity to determine how I want to live the rest of my life.</description>

      <description>Perplexity AI (https://www.perplexity.ai) has been gaining attention in the world of chatbots and large language models. I had heard about it in a few forums and mentioned by industry leaders like Jensen Huang and Kelsey Hightower. In fact, I had created an account and tried it out a few times earlier this year, but didn&amp;rsquo;t take it much seriously.&#xA;All that changed last week when I watched this recent interview of Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas by Lex Fridman.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, Next.js introduced App Router, a new way to build React applications using the latest features like React Server components and streaming. This was included in Next.js version 13 and is meant to replace the Pages Router eventually. I have been using the App Router for all my builder projects for a while now. In fact, I usually kicked off projects with the standard create-next-app script that starts a new app from scratch.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last shared an update on my Reimagine journey that started three months ago. Initially, I used to share my progress every week and it helped me build momentum during the early stages. But after some time, this weekly ritual became tedious - sometimes taking up an entire day for a single post. So I decided to share updates based on significant milestones rather than tying them to specific points in time.</description>

This event was special in many ways - for me, this is the first conference I attended since the pandemic and the first one during my new journey; for OpenAI, this is their first developer conference ever! So I think it deserves a dedicated blog post to share the highlights, key takeaways and my observations, right?</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I stood at the crossroads of my career thinking about my next chapter. I loved my job, my team, and was at the peak of my career as a leader. Yet, I yearned for a return to the world of hands-on development, where I could immerse myself in the flow of code.&#xA;The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I want to pivot my career towards the goal of coding, learning and building with tech.</description>

      <description>OpenAI published the GPT-4 Technical Report on 27 Mar 2023. I wanted to read it immediately but was intimidated by the fact that it is a 100-page document. It turns out that it was not as difficult as I anticipated, it can be easily read over a weekend. The best part is that this report describes the key terminologies and methodologies used in the development of GPT-4. It&amp;rsquo;s always beneficial to obtain this information directly from the source.</description>

      <description>Ever since ChatGPT was released to the public last November, I&amp;rsquo;ve been eager to write a blog about it. However, the daunting prospect of facing a blank screen kept me from starting the task, and I found myself procrastinating. Today, I finally summoned the courage to begin writing, but with a few tweaks from my usual approach.&#xA;Allow me to describe the meta experiment to understand how I can utilize ChatGPT to help me write the blog.</description>

I am fascinated by this technology and learning more about it everyday. With this introductory post, I hope to share my knowledge and insights on ChatGPT - how it works, its capabilities and limitations, potential pitfalls, and future prospects.&#xA;Note - Just for fun, I did an experiment to write two more versions of this post - one that was written by ChatGPT itself using a rough outline I provided, and another also written by ChatGPT, but imrprovised from my original post.</description>

      <description>Today I upgraded my blog engine Hugo from version 0.30.0 to 0.73.0. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I upgraded, so I was not sure how easy or difficult it will be. The upgrade completed quickly, but my entire home page (running locally) went blank right after the upgrade. With a good amount of googling, reading through the documentation and a few tweaks in my folder structure, I was able to bring it back up and running and published it.</description>

      <description>After a long time, I got the time to tinker with something fun and learn from it, thanks to the week-long break from work. The task at hand is to set up Visual Studio for Mac to compile/run/debug C++ programs. Why, you may wonder - for the past few months, I have been craving to learn something different and I was hooked when I saw the book Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ by Adam Drozdek.</description>

      <description>The other day I watched a TED video where the presenter urged the audience to ask the question What do you really want? That got me thinking what do I really want. It is an interesting question to ask myself, since I have tried different roles and responsibilites - broad and deep - in the last couple of years.&#xA;So I was pleasantly surprised when I found the book Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ by Adam Drozdek on my bookshelf.</description>

      <description>One of the challenges of mobile application development is to ensure that the application is resilient to various error responses from the services that are consumed by the application. Mobile devices are more susceptible to network connectivity issues, timeout etc. So we need to take extra care to make sure that we test all error scenarios and handle them in a meaningful manner.&#xA;What and Why of Mocking Even though we are convinced about the benefits of testing server errors, these services are running in Production serving real customer requests.</description>

      <description>I use Xcode playground a lot in order to write code snippets - either to try out something that I read in a blog, or to demonstrate a code improvement that I want to suggest in a code review, or sometimes even to prototype a design before doing the full-blown implementation in Xcode project. During this experimentation phase, the correctness of the code was verified by analyzing the ouput displayed on the right-hand side column of the playground.</description>

      <description>As part of my Machine Learning course, I learned a useful trick which I will share hoping that it may help someone or I myself can refer to it later. The problem at hand was how to display the mathematical expressions that calculate cost function, gradient descent etc. in a blog or web page. In OneNote, you can do it using OneNote Equation tool earlier, but I wanted to do the same in my blog posts.</description>

      <description>Few weeks ago, I started the Machine Learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng of Stanford University. The course is great, learning a lot of new concepts. Sometimes it is hard, but it is really fun learning this new topic and brushing up the old Math lessons of Linear Algebra, matrix manipulation and derivatives.&#xA;The course starts with the basics, including a primer on Linear Algebra (it is optional, but I took it anyway since it has been more than a decade when I learned it in college).</description>

      <description>I have been thoroughly enjoying working on ReactNative projects, but was disappointed by the lack of a good debugging environment. I had tried multiple solutions like Nuclide (which I found it to be very slow), WebStorm with JSX plugins (which is mainly syntax recognition). So I had to always launch the app from Xcode/Android Studio, then attach Chrome Dev tools and keep switching between all three for debugging. This was frustrating, but there is hope&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>The User Interface is going beyond UI and voice recognition to the new trend of using conversation as a new way to engage with customers, i.e. Conversation As Interface. It is a more natural form of communication, especially for question-answer / interview experiences.&#xA;Now there is an emerging trend of companies opening their chat bot API to third party developers. Facebook has been running many experiments in their Messenger app allowing a few developers like Uber, Assist etc.</description>

      <description>This is my first blog post created by Hugo, a simple, fast and powerful blogging engine written in Go. Setting up my blog on Hugo was quick and easy; it took less than 4 hours.&#xA;I have set this up such that I publish the content to GitHub pages, so the publish workflow is as simple as writing some Markdown and a git push. This is a good tutorial on how to do this.</description>
