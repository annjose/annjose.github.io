  <p>This is the fast follow (Part 2) of the previous post <a href="https://annjose.com/post/openai-devday-2023-highlights">OpenAI DevDay 2023 - Highlights</a> (aka Part 1) where I shared the highlights and the announcements made at <a href="https://devday.openai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI DevDay 2023</a>.</p>
<p>In this post right here, I will share <strong>my observations</strong> - about the event and OpenAI tech - and <strong>my learnings</strong> - from talking to people during the event and by trying out the tech hands-on. So, let&rsquo;s jump in!</p>
<h2 id="about-the-event">About the event</h2>
<ul>
<li>I felt that the DevDay had an indie vibe to it, perhaps because most of the people there were startups and OpenAI is a young startup itself. I loved that!</li>
<li>The attendees mostly were passionate and practitioners of this technology - some were tinkering with the tech, some have built startup business around it.</li>
<li>The crowd was also very friendly - all the attendees were eager to connect with each other and learn what they are doing. There was a feeling of &lsquo;we are in this together, learning and doing&rsquo;.</li>
<li>All the sessions were developer friendly - Sam and all the presenters repeatedly said - we heard loud and clear from developers and we made this change because of that.</li>
<li>All the demos were live on stage - which was really refreshing, especially after a series of pre-recorded tech announcements lately.</li>
<li>The sessions were well rehearsed and timed. The content was meaningful and relevant to us.</li>
<li>The food was also great, nice spread of all cuisines and great desserts too!</li>
<li>My travel to the event was also interesting. I decided to take Caltrain, but it was delayed by an hour, thanks to the electrification work. On the positive side, I made a few acquaintances at the station - all of them are regular commuters and said that the train schedule is awry for the last 2 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-the-tech-of-openai">About the tech of OpenAI</h2>
<ul>
<li>this company is moving so fast, they are fully benefiting from the first-mover advantage. Yes, other models are also improving quickly, but GPT-4 series will progress further ahead.</li>
<li>Plugins are replaced by the actions in the GPTs. OpenAI&rsquo;s strategy to bring in the agent experiences with GPTs and make it availabe through ChatGPT and Assistants API.</li>
<li>I think Completions API will be replaced by the Assistants API. OpenAI has all modalities - text, image, voice (and next video I guess)</li>
<li>By introducing GPTs with built-in RAG <a href="https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a>, OpenAI has taken a giant leap in building agent-like experiences. And you can do it easily- no need to maintain state, conversation history, pass in a ton of context into the prompt. Amazing!</li>
<li>AI apps and agents are here to stay and OpenAI is making it so easy to do! I can almost hear them saying &quot; Auto GPT - move over! It&rsquo;s show time.&quot;</li>
<li>I remember one of the panelists saying that all the problems that we see now with LLMs like latency, cost etc. will go away very soon. Don&rsquo;t wait for the problems to be solved - in fact, seeing the current pace, OpenAI will solve faster than any of us. So we should focus on using this tech and building the solutions around it.</li>
<li>Companies should unlock the power of LLMs completely - the tech is evolving so fast that it would be a mistake to build abstractions around it. Companies who want the competitive edge in the AI space should leverage the full extent of the tech and learn continuously by trying out.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learnings-from-networking">Learnings from networking</h2>
<p>Here is what I learned from talking to OpenAI team and hanging out with the other attendees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Heuristics to decide when to use RAG vs Fine-tuning
<ul>
<li>when you want to give new knowledge to LLM, use RAG.</li>
<li>when you want LLM to do a new task (with existing knowledge) - fine-tune</li>
<li>When you have pushed the boundary of RAG and not getting the results, try RAG + fine-tuning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Best approach - start with prompt engineering, if that is not enough, do RAG; if this is also not enough, add fine-tuning</li>
<li>Heuristics to decide when to use Assistants API this vs. roll your own system.
<ul>
<li>they said if you are building a chatbot that expands its knowledge by calling an API or adding docs, creating embeddings and storing in vector store, your needs will be met just using Assistants API.</li>
<li>If you want to do more custom things, then you can build your own. Of course, you need to check all data protection measures with OpenAI Assistants API.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>a startup founder I met at the event said that most of the things that I have built so far need to be changed all over (for example, ChatGPT plugin to GPTs, but that&rsquo;s ok. He was excited about the reach and agency he is getting with this technology.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learnings-from-hands-on-experiments">Learnings from hands-on experiments</h2>
<p>I made a simple custom GPT using the new GPT Builder. My GPT is &ldquo;Bug Hunter&rdquo; which will find bugs in the code. I pasted some code I had written during the JS course and asked &lsquo;is there anything wrong with this code&rsquo; - it understood it correctly and suggested that I test for negative numbers, zeroes and non-integer numbers also! And (wait for it) - it told me &rsquo;to make the error message better, you can enhance the error message to include the input params x and y!&quot;  It explained what is wrong in the code, and gave the fix for the bug also. Then I gave another code that works correctly, and it explained it properly too. It showed the output also correctly.</p>
<p>After publishing this custom GPT, I modified its behavior to focus <strong>only on bug hunting</strong> and <strong>not code formatting</strong> - using &ldquo;Configure&rdquo; tab in GPT Builder. With this change, it gracefully declines any formatting requests.</p>
<p>The whole experience was so amazing and magical that I wanted to tell someone. Since I was alone at home, I <a href="https://twitter.com/annjose/status/1722677077286260945" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted about it immediately</a>.</p>
<p>You can see the custom GPT here - <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-fa1XjkATp-bug-hunter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT - Bug Hunter (openai.com)</a>. And you can build your own GPTs with a Plus account or ChatGPT Enterprise.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a great experience attending this event - I learned a lot, met a lot of people and had fun!</p>
