  <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I last shared an update on my <a href="https://annjose.com/tags/new-beginning/">Reimagine journey</a> that started three months ago. Initially, I used to share my progress every week and it helped me build momentum during the early stages. But after some time, this weekly ritual became tedious - sometimes taking up an entire day for a single post. So I decided to share updates based on significant <strong>milestones</strong> rather than tying them to specific <strong>points in time</strong>.</p>
<p>Today, I am thrilled to share a significant milestone of my journey - I am transitioning from the phase of learning to building - as a maker, a coder.</p>
<h3 id="the-transition">The Transition</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="post/new-beginning/">initial post</a>, the primary objective of my Reimagine journey was to revive my identity as a <strong>Tech Builder</strong> - to be fully hands-on with code and build technical solutions. Technology has always been my passion and my 18-year tenure as an individual contributor — working across desktop, full-stack, and mobile development — built my love for coding and developed an intuition to look under the hood. However, ever since I took on people leadership responsibilities, I had to give up my coding time. This shift was necessary and the right thing to do for my my team, my job and my company. During that time, I continued to follow technology news and occassionally dabbled on small coding experiments, but none of it came close to spending long periods of uninterrupted coding - a passion I wanted to renew.</p>
<p>The past three months have been dedicated to the &lsquo;<strong>learning mode</strong>&rsquo; - focused on refreshing and mastering the fundamentals of web development. Starting with the plain vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, progressing through TypeScript, React, NextJS and explored a few CSS frameworks along the way. Throughout this time, I was not only learning concepts, but also writing a lot of code - mostly examples and exercises from the courses I was doing. All of that code is published in my github repo<a href="https://github.com/annjose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/annjose</a>. It solidified the fundamentals and necessary tools, giving me the confidence needed to take the next step.</p>
<p>Beginning of this year, I decided to switch from learning mode to &lsquo;<strong>building mode</strong>&rsquo; - with the goal of building the skill to quickly translating ideas to code - combining a few APIs, tools and see it in action in a simple UI. I think I am able to do that now, specifically a few instances described below.</p>
<h3 id="a-few-examples">A few examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I came across a great tool - <a href="https://asciinema.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asciinema</a> - that can record terminal sessions in a lightweight text format. It was super easy to use and pretty cool. I explored it a little bit and realized that you can record sessions (as casts) and embed the cast file in a web page using Asciinema Player and interact with it using a simple API. I tried it out, read their <a href="https://docs.asciinema.org/manual/player/quick-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation and QuickStart guide</a> built a React component that hosts that player and delpoyed it - all within an hour!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the holidays, our family was discussing an idea of visiting all national parks in the US during our lifetime. I wanted to see a list of all national parks and choose which ones to go first. I looked up the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Park Service website</a>, but it was not intuitive for my purpose - there was no easy way to search for parks in specific states or specific activities and I had to go into each page one by one. As a sheer coincidence, the very next day, there was <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39085830" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a HackerNews post</a> that the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/digital/nps-data-api.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NPS Data API</a> is available for everyone to use. I was elated. I looked up <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their documentation</a>, signed up for an API key and tried out the APIs - just simple code to call the API and get the data that I was looking for - all done in under 30 min.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As my collection of tiny web apps continue to grow (a Tic tac Toe game, a frontend for <a href="https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Movie Database (TMDB) API</a>, the Asciinema player host and more), I decided to build an uber &lsquo;playground&rsquo; app. The goal was to host these tiny apps, but I was running them locally. All of these had silly UI and very simple code, but I wanted to publish them to public domain. I chose Vercel as the deployment platform, read their documentation and tweaked my code here and there to match their deployment configuration. It was a very straight-forward process - thanks to Vercel&rsquo;s impeccable docs and seamless GitOps implementation. Within an hour, all my tiny apps, along with the playground app, were published successfully.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Being able to create apps like these quickly and seeing in action in the public domain was pure joy to me. The fact that the code I had written was now running in a production environment, regardless of their simplicity, was deeply fulfilling. It gave me so much joy that day - almost like a dopamine hit - and I roamed around my home with a wide smile on my face.</p>
<h3 id="two-key-takeaways">Two key takeaways</h3>
<p>Relfecting on the past three months of learning mode, I realize two key things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>web development has advanced so much in the past few years - the tools, the programming languages and the frameworks have evolved a lot. The best part if that it is super easy to get started and accessible to everyone. Of course, the tech is evolving at a rapid pace, but once you nail the fundamentals, it is not hard to stay up-to-date. Of course, we need the time and have to choose the right tool for the right job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when I am in this building mode, I am in the flow - I feel the world around me disappears and I am in my groove - leaving only my IDE, git and code. I love that feeling and I am reminded how much I missed it in the past three years. On a typical day, I manage to allocate around 4-5 hours for learning/coding alongside my health routine, home responsibilities and pursuing my hobbies. It os a good balance and enjoy every minute of these sessions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-few-important-updates">A few important updates</h3>
<p>My <strong>health routine</strong> is continuing to go steady. I am still continuing the strenght exercise routine three days a week and walking 30 min everyday. This month, I started a new routine of rowing 2000m three days a week and running 0.5 miles a day. Many of these routines, which were hard in the beginning, have become easier and starting to be second nature to me. Daily/weekly reflections and planning my day and week in Obsidian helps a lot. I still follow the bullet journal method - but augmented it with a digital version in Obsidian. I intend to write a dedicated post on how I plan my day and week, and what is working and what is not. There is no &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; way, but I tweak it every day and steadily make progress - one day at a time.</p>
<p>In the realm of hobbies, I picked up a crazy one - <strong>(re)learning Mathematics</strong>. I did my masters in Mathematics two decades ago, but I didn&rsquo;t realize how much I loved it until now when I started learning it again through an excellent learning platform called <a href="https://mathacademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Math Academy</a> (you can probably guess where I found it? - yes, on HN). They have a lot of Math courses, uniquely designed for accelerated learning, tailore for children and adults. It incorporates spaced repetition and pre-requisites for each concept.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right now, I am doing the course <a href="https://mathacademy.com/courses/mathematical-foundations-i" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mathematical Foundations - Part I</a> and I wnat to progress to the course <a href="https://mathacademy.com/courses/mathematics-for-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mathematics for Machine Learning</a>.</li>
<li>What I appreciate the most is its singular focus on mathematics – when I&rsquo;m engrossed in solving problems, that&rsquo;s precisely what I&rsquo;m doing, without any distractions or unnecessary gamification. There is a leaderboard on the side and you can see your progress, but it is not distracting.
It is deeply satifying to rekindle the love for Math.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, a few weeks ago, I had the fantastic opportunity to <strong>meet my awesome team at Intuit</strong> for lunch. I met some of them 1:1 off campus as well. It was a wonderful reunion - was great to reconnect with everyone and catch up like old times. All of them are doing well, advancing in their career (many of them got promoted Yay!), embracing new opportunities and tackling new challenges. My team has always been a part of me - personally and profressionally. Seeing their growth and continuous learning is truly inspiring to me.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>All in all, my journey is going well - with a good mix of learning, building, taking care of health, and cherishing moments with family and friends. Once again, I am very grateful and proud that I am able to pursue this path of personal growth. My new year&rsquo;s resolution is to <strong>build a healthy body, active brain and relaxed mind</strong>. I feel confident and excited to fulfil that resolution in the year ahead.</p>
