      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, if you had told me I’d be deadlifting 155 lbs, I would have laughed and said, &amp;ldquo;No way!&amp;rdquo; But here I am, doing it—something I never thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/reimagine-milestone/&#34;&gt;post in my reimagine journey&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about reframing milestones to focus on consistency rather than arbitrary goals. At the time, I was working out on my own, trying to stay active with strength training and Zone 2 walks. I was making some progress, but it was small and I felt stuck. Looking back, I realize it wasn’t a lack of effort—it was a lack of structure, consistency, and progression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
