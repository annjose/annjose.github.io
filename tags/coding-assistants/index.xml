      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to think that I love coding, but in the last year, I came to realize that I love building apps as much as I love coding. Creating something useful and beautiful is what I love. Last year this time, my coding workflow was to fire up VS Code with  Claude in the browser or GitHub Copilot in &amp;lsquo;Ask&amp;rsquo; mode and brainstorm problems, review solutions suggested by the LLM, copy code into the editor, test and deploy. This was fun in the beginning, but soon the context-switching became tedious and it broke the flow of building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vibe coding a Pomodoro app with AI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I tried something fun - built a Pomodoro timer app mostly by talking to AI instead of typing code myself. And guess what - there is a term for it - &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;vibe coding&lt;/a&gt;, coined by Andrej Karpathy 😎.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have done it a few times before, but this is the first time I am using it to build a full app. I wanted to create something that was useful and worked well, so I chose the Pomodoro timer. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it went and my key takeaways from this way of building products.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Claude Code: First Impressions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt;, the new agentic coding tool &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;announced by Anthropic&lt;/a&gt; this morning. Unlike other agentic tools, Claude Code is a CLI tool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Claude has been my favorite AI coding partner so far. I use it via GitHub Copilot and as standalone through its web interface. I was curious to see how it works in CLI and decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this post, I share my first impressions of using Claude Code - how I set it up, what I loved about it, what I didn&amp;rsquo;t, and how it compares to other similar tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
