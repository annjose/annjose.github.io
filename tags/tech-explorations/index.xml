      <description>I have been eager to write a blog about ChatGPT since its release last year, but was held back by the fear of facing a blank page and the challenge of starting to write. Today, I finally mustered up the courage and sat down to write. I followed my usual process by creating an outline of what I wanted to cover in the blog post.
However, I decided to do a meta experiment and see how I could utilize ChatGPT to help me write the blog.</description>

      <description>ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that can hold human-like conversations on a vast array of topics. Developed by OpenAI, the creators of DallE-2, a popular AI text-to-image generator, and Whisper, a powerful speech recognition system, ChatGPT is designed to answer questions, write code, summarize text, and explain concepts using natural language processing.
ChatGPT is currently in its research preview phase and is available for everyone to use for free. However, OpenAI recently announced ChatGPT Plus, a subscription plan that costs $20 per month.</description>

      <description>Have you ever heard of ChatGPT? It&amp;rsquo;s a large language model that has taken the AI world by storm. But what exactly is ChatGPT and how does it work? This post will break down the basics and give you a good understanding of what it is, how it&amp;rsquo;s built and how it can be used in the real world.
What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is a language model that combines the GPT part (Generative Pretrained Transformer) with the chat part.</description>

      <description>Like many of you, I have been reading about ChatGPT in various forums and from industry experts. This blog post is a brief summary of my understanding of ChatGPT - what is it, how it works, its power and pitfalls, and its future potential in my perspective.
And finally, to have some fun, I wrote this article in three ways - using the conventional method of writing it by myself (this post), asking ChatGPT to write it using my outline and then asking it to improvise my conventional version.</description>

      <title>Tinkering with VS Code, MacOS and C&#43;&#43;</title>

      <description>After a long time, I got the time to tinker with something fun and learn from it, thanks to the week-long break from work. The task at hand is to set up Visual Studio for Mac to compile/run/debug C++ programs. Why, you may wonder - for the past few months, I have been craving to learn something different and I was hooked when I saw the book Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ by Adam Drozdek.</description>

      <description>In this post, I would like to share what&amp;rsquo;s new in Swift 4.2. All the code displayed in this post is available at my GitHub repo my-learnings/Swift4.2.
Random Number Generation Swift 4.2 added random number generator API to standard library. You can use it on Int, Double, Float, CGFloat and Bool. It also provides a convenient API randomElement which returns a random element from a sequence It also provides the APIs shuffle and shuffled to shuffle a sequence 1 2 let randomInt = Int.</description>

      <title>TDD in Xcode Playground</title>

      <description>I use Xcode playground a lot in order to write code snippets - either to try out something that I read in a blog, or to demonstrate a code improvement that I want to suggest in a code review, or sometimes even to prototype a design before doing the full-blown implementation in Xcode project. During this experimentation phase, the correctness of the code was verified by analyzing the ouput displayed on the right-hand side column of the playground.</description>

      <description>Realm is a company that I respect a lot because of their support for mobile developers and the open nature nature of their offerings. Their easy-to-use, blazingly fast Mobile database software supports all mobile platforms - iOS, Android, React Native and Xamarin, in Java, ObjC, Swift and C#. That is why I am happy to see that today they announced Realm Mobile Platform that combines Realm client side database with server-side technology (Object Server as they call it).</description>

      <title>Machine Learning - A new journey</title>

      <description>Few weeks ago, I started the Machine Learning course on Coursera by Andrew Ng of Stanford University. The course is great, learning a lot of new concepts. Sometimes it is hard, but it is really fun learning this new topic and brushing up the old Math lessons of Linear Algebra, matrix manipulation and derivatives.
The course starts with the basics, including a primer on Linear Algebra (it is optional, but I took it anyway since it has been more than a decade when I learned it in college).</description>

      <title>ReactNative in Visual Studio Code</title>
      <link>https://ann.chiramattel.com/post/react-native-visual-studio-code/</link>

      <description>I have been thoroughly enjoying working on ReactNative projects, but was disappointed by the lack of a good debugging environment. I had tried multiple solutions like Nuclide (which I found it to be very slow), WebStorm with JSX plugins (which is mainly syntax recognition). So I had to always launch the app from Xcode/Android Studio, then attach Chrome Dev tools and keep switching between all three for debugging. This was frustrating, but there is hope&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Conversation as Interface</title>

      <description>The User Interface is going beyond UI and voice recognition to the new trend of using conversation as a new way to engage with customers, i.e. Conversation As Interface. It is a more natural form of communication, especially for question-answer / interview experiences.
Now there is an emerging trend of companies opening their chat bot API to third party developers. Facebook has been running many experiments in their Messenger app allowing a few developers like Uber, Assist etc.</description>

      <description>This is my first blog post created by Hugo, a simple, fast and powerful blogging engine written in Go. Setting up my blog on Hugo was quick and easy; it took less than 4 hours.
I have set this up such that I publish the content to GitHub pages, so the publish workflow is as simple as writing some Markdown and a git push. This is a good tutorial on how to do this.</description>
