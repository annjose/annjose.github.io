      <description>Last week, I watched an interview of Aravind Srinivas, the CEO of Perplexity AI (https://www.perplexity.ai). It is a three-hour interview done by Lex Fridman where Aravind talked about the major breakthroughs in AI that brought us to LLMs, the mission of Perplexity, how the technology works, his vision of the future of search and web in general, and some valuable advice for startup founders and young people.&#xA;Fascinating interview - highly recommended for everyone to watch.</description>

      <description>Perplexity AI (https://www.perplexity.ai) has been gaining attention in the world of chatbots and large language models. I had heard about it in a few forums and mentioned by industry leaders like Jensen Huang and Kelsey Hightower. In fact, I had created an account and tried it out a few times earlier this year, but didn&amp;rsquo;t take it much seriously.&#xA;All that changed last week when I watched this recent interview of Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas by Lex Fridman.</description>

Apple Intelligence comprises of multiple highly-capable and efficient generative models - large language models and diffusion models. These models include on-device models as well as server-based foundation models.&#xA;The foundation models are trained on Apple&amp;rsquo;s open-source AXLearn library for deep learning, built on top of JAX (Python library for accelerated computing and transformation) and XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra, an open-source ML compiler).</description>
