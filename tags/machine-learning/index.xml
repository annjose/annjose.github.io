      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perplexity AI&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.perplexity.ai&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://www.perplexity.ai&lt;/a&gt;) has been gaining attention in the world of chatbots and large language models. I had heard about it in a few forums and mentioned by industry leaders like Jensen Huang and Kelsey Hightower. In fact, I had created an account and tried it out a few times earlier this year, but didn&amp;rsquo;t take it much seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All that changed last week when I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-gwvmhyU7A&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this recent interview&lt;/a&gt; of Perplexity CEO &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aravind-srinivas-16051987/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Aravind Srinivas&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/lexfridman/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lex Fridman&lt;/a&gt;. It is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-gwvmhyU7A&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;fascinating interview&lt;/a&gt; - highly recommended for everyone to watch, but personally, it opened my eyes to the fact that Perplexity is very different from other chatbots, not only in how it works, but what it is trying to solve. So I started using it for a few days and was blown away by the results 💯. I realized that this is one of the tools that gives you so much value that you cannot imagine going back to the way of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since ChatGPT was released to the public last November, I&amp;rsquo;ve been eager to write a blog about it. However, the daunting prospect of facing a blank screen kept me from starting the task, and I found myself procrastinating. Today, I finally summoned the courage to begin writing, but with a few tweaks from my usual approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allow me to describe the meta experiment to understand how I can utilize ChatGPT to help me write the blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, ChatGPT has captured my attention through numerous forums, articles and AI experts. I am fascinated by this technology and learning more about it everyday. With this introductory post, I hope to share my knowledge and insights on ChatGPT - how it works, its capabilities and limitations, potential pitfalls, and future prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note - Just for fun, I did an experiment to write two more versions of this post - one that was written by ChatGPT itself using a rough outline I provided, and another also written by ChatGPT, but imrprovised from my original post. Curious to see the results of the experiment? Head over to the meta post &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/chatgpt-intro-3-ways&#34;&gt;Blog about ChatGPT in three different ways&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note - This post is written by ChatGPT by rewriting my original post &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/chatgpt-intro&#34;&gt;An Introduction to ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; - section by section. This is a fun exercise to demonstrate the potential of ChatGPT and how it can change how we create content, art and code. You can see the full results of the experiment at &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/chatgpt-intro-3-ways&#34;&gt;Blog about ChatGPT in three different ways&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an avid learner and technology enthusiast, I have been following the advancements and discussions surrounding ChatGPT in various forums and sources. With this blog post, I aim to share my understanding of ChatGPT - what it is, its key benefits, potential limitations, and my vision of its future trajectory. Through my research and analysis of expert opinions, I hope to provide a comprehensive overview of this cutting-edge technology and its potential impact on our daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
