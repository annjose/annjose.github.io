      <description>It has been a week since I started my leave of absence to pivot my career to be more hands on in tech. Here is how my Week 1 was, hence the name Week in Review. Fair warning - this is mostly a stream of consciousness instead of a well-formatted post, because it was important that I publish it at the end of the week - progress not perfection!
What I did during the week started learning two JavaScript courses in parallel - Modern JavaScript by Execute Program and Learn JavaScript by Jad Joubran.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I stood at the crossroads of my career thinking about my next chapter. I loved my job, my team, and was at the peak of my career as a leader. Yet, I yearned for a return to the world of hands-on development, where I could immerse myself in the flow of code.
The more I thought about it, the more I was convinced that I want to pivot my career towards the goal of coding, learning and building with tech.</description>
