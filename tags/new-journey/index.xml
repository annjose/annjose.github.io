      <description>OK, here we are at Week #2 of the &amp;ldquo;new journey&amp;rdquo; I set forth mid October. A journey which did not get a specific name, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I guess some things are better served unnamed, yeah? Anyway, let&amp;rsquo;s jump into the review. As always, this is free flow writing and I will follow the same format as last week&amp;rsquo;s review.
What I did during the week An honest review of this week should start by reviewing the goals I set out at the beginning of the week.</description>
