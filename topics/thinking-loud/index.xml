      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started watching the YouTube series Talks at Google and today I came across this video &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-ONEAcBeTk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; by Angela Duckworth, the researcher, author and professor of Psychology at UPenn. I had seen her TED talk earlier and this talk was even better where whe unpacked a lot of details on the concept of grit. This post is to share the key takeaways I got from the talk.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I watched a TED video where the presenter urged the audience to ask the question &lt;strong&gt;What do you really want?&lt;/strong&gt; That got me thinking what do &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; really want. It is an interesting question to ask myself, since I have tried different roles and responsibilites - broad and deep - in the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I was pleasantly surprised when I found the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Adam-Drozdek-dp-1133608426/dp/1133608426&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data Structures and Algorithms in C++&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Drozdek on my bookshelf. The book is full of code and exercises in C++, a language which I haven&amp;rsquo;t used in a while.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
