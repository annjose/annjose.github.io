      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of late, I have been building and &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/browser-extn-intro/&#34;&gt;learning about browser extensions&lt;/a&gt; for a few projects. It was surprising to learn that there are many ways to build UI for these extensions and the most interesting one was the Side Panel UI available to Chrome extensions. In this post, I will talk about the Chrome side panel, how to build one and the advantages and limitations of using it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-chrome-side-panel&#34;&gt;The Chrome side panel&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a vertical panel that opens on either side of the browser window, providing quick access to your bookmarks, history, reading list, and Google Lens. It has a consistent layout and behavior across all websites. It was first introduced in Chrome in May 2023.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of my blog series on browser extensions. Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll delve into advanced concepts including TypeScript integration, service workers, and programmatic script injection. For a solid foundation, I recommend reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://annjose.com/post/browser-extn-intro/&#34;&gt;Browser Extensions: Part 1 - Introduction&lt;/a&gt; before tackling these more complex topics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-use-typescript-in-browser-extensions&#34;&gt;How to use TypeScript in browser extensions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, browser extensions use JavaScript as the programming language in the content scripts. However, TypeScript is more type safe and reliable to write the business logic. You can add TypeScript support to the extension project, but how do you do it? Chrome docs mention this as a one-liner as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
