      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thoroughly enjoying working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ReactNative&lt;/a&gt; projects, but was disappointed by the lack of a good debugging environment. I had tried multiple solutions like &lt;a href=&#34;http://nuclide.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nuclide&lt;/a&gt; (which I found it to be very slow), WebStorm with JSX plugins (which is mainly syntax recognition). So I had to always launch the app from Xcode/Android Studio, then attach Chrome Dev tools and keep switching between all three for debugging. This was frustrating, but there is hope&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
