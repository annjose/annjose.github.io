      <title>Tinkering with VS Code, MacOS and C&#43;&#43;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a long time, I got the time to tinker with something fun and learn from it, thanks to the week-long break from work. The task at hand is to set up Visual Studio for Mac to compile/run/debug C++ programs. Why, you may wonder - for the past few months, I have been craving to learn something different and I was hooked when I saw the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Adam-Drozdek-dp-1133608426/dp/1133608426&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data Structures and Algorithms in C++&lt;/a&gt; by Adam Drozdek. I decided to read this book and learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ReactNative in Visual Studio Code</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thoroughly enjoying working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ReactNative&lt;/a&gt; projects, but was disappointed by the lack of a good debugging environment. I had tried multiple solutions like &lt;a href=&#34;http://nuclide.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Nuclide&lt;/a&gt; (which I found it to be very slow), WebStorm with JSX plugins (which is mainly syntax recognition). So I had to always launch the app from Xcode/Android Studio, then attach Chrome Dev tools and keep switching between all three for debugging. This was frustrating, but there is hope&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
