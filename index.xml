      <title>Machine Learning - A New Journey</title>
      <link>http://ann.chiramattel.com/post/machine-learning-coursera/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few weeks ago, I started the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning&#34;&gt;Machine Learning course on Coursera&lt;/a&gt; by Andrew Ng of Stanford University. The course is great, learning a lot of new concepts. Sometimes it is hard, but it is really fun learning this new topic and brushing up the old Math lessons of Linear Algebra, matrix manipulation and derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course starts with the basics, including a primer on Linear Algebra (it is optional, but I took it anyway since it has been more than a decade when I learned it in college). At the end of each module, there is a quiz and programming assignments, which are interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the content, I love the way this course is making me think hard and concentrate for long periods of time to understand the concepts and basics. This experience is very different from learning a new programming language or framework where there is a set pattern of how you learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I had started the course early this year, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep up with the schedule due to work load. But this time, I am forcing myself to stick with it because I want to learn the subject as soon as I can. I am convinced that Machine Learning is the future of technology and I have to master it sooner than later. After all, as Douglas Rushkoff reminds us, I want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Program-Be-Programmed-Commands-Digital/dp/159376426X&#34;&gt;Program, not Be Programmed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ReactNative in Visual Studio Code</title>
      <link>http://ann.chiramattel.com/post/react-native-visual-studio-code/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been thoroughly enjoying working on &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/&#34;&gt;ReactNative&lt;/a&gt; projects, but was disappointed by the lack of a good debugging environment. I had tried multiple solutions like &lt;a href=&#34;http://nuclide.io/&#34;&gt;Nuclide&lt;/a&gt; (which I found it to be very slow), WebStorm with JSX plugins (which is mainly syntax recognition). So I had to always launch the app from Xcode/Android Studio, then attach Chrome Dev tools and keep switching between all three for debugging. This was frustrating, but there is hope&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reactnative.com/react-native-tools-extension-for-visual-studio-code/&#34;&gt;ReactJS conference in February&lt;/a&gt; announced the release of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-react-native&#34;&gt;ReactNative extension&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.visualstudio.com/&#34;&gt;VisualStudio Code&lt;/a&gt;, the lightweight editor by Microsoft. The name &amp;lsquo;Visual Studio&amp;rsquo; may sound heavy, but &lt;strong&gt;VS Code&lt;/strong&gt; is a completely new editor built from ground-up based on Electron. It is super fast, flexible, configurable and Open Source too! The ReactNative extension for VS Code supports intellisense, ability to run react-native commands and most importantly, full-fledged debugging experience - yeah yeah breakpoints, call stack and stuff :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to code this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial&#34;&gt;ReactNative tutorial by Ray Wenderlich&lt;/a&gt; in VS Code using this extension and it was absolutely brilliant. The UI is very clean, clutter-free with subtle yet vivid colors. As soon as I opened the starter project, it recognized that it is a ReactNative project and got it ready to go. Then I simply put a breakpoint and hit the Debug Run button and Viola! - my app started and the breakpoint was hit. I can step through code, inspect callstack, local variables, debug console etc. all in one place!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Conversation As Interface</title>
      <link>http://ann.chiramattel.com/post/conversation-as-interface/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The User Interface is going beyond UI and voice recognition to the new trend of using conversation as a new way to engage with customers, i.e. &lt;strong&gt;Conversation As Interface&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a more natural form of communication, especially for question-answer / interview experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there is an emerging trend of companies opening their chat bot API to third party developers. Facebook &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/05/facebook-messenger-bots/&#34;&gt;has been doing experiments&lt;/a&gt; in their Messenger app allowing a few developers like Uber, Assist etc. to create chat bots. They are &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/07/facebook-chatbots/&#34;&gt;expected to announce&lt;/a&gt; opening up the SDK to all in next week’s F8 conference. Microsoft &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/30/microsoft-is-bringing-bots-to-skype-and-everywhere-else/&#34;&gt;released a Bot Framework&lt;/a&gt; in Build last week and this supports multiple channels – Slack, SMS, Skype etc. Similarly, &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/24/line-builds-out-its-chat-app-for-businesses-as-facebook-messenger-threat-looms-large/&#34;&gt;Line&lt;/a&gt; announced its SDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chat bots could be a new way to reach customers even when the app is not installed. And if they support deep linking, then developers can deliver a smooth transition into sepcific flows in the app. This is a great opportunity to be where our users are. It will be interesting to see how this idea pans out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Post from Hugo</title>
      <link>http://ann.chiramattel.com/post/first-post-from-hugo/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2015 00:49:45 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://ann.chiramattel.com/post/first-post-from-hugo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my first blog post created by &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a simple, fast and powerful blogging engine written in Go. Setting up my blog on Hugo was quick and easy; it took less than 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have set this up such that I publish the content to &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt;, so the publish workflow is as simple as writing some Markdown and a git push. &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/&#34;&gt;This is a good tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what I love about Hugo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static content generation, which means blazing fast rendering, no need to manage databases, VMs etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very easy to publish content - create content in markdown and simple git push&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No dependency issues; literally runs out of the box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly customizable UI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good opportunity to learn &lt;a href=&#34;https://golang.org/&#34;&gt;Go language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I am just loving Hugo. Next step is to explore it further and customize it to my heart&amp;rsquo;s content.
